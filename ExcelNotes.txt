*****Excel Notes*****

1. Sum of a column
=sum(d4:d7)
=sumif(d4:d7,">50")
Alt + =

Question: Try adding another SUMIF formula here, but add amounts that are less than 100. The result should be 160.
=sumif(G10:G14,"<100")


2. Fill (drag and drop)
=SUM(C4:D4)		(here this formula add the rows) and drag n drop
=SUM(C11:C14)	(here this formula add the columns) and drag n drop

we can use shortkey also ctrl+r (filling right), ctrl+d (filling down)

3. Split
write first name -> then write first name of next row -> then excel automatic fill all first name 
select all columns and press CTRL + E (this is the shortkey for flash fill)

4. Transpose
Item	Bread	Donuts	Cookies	Cakes	Pies
Amount	50		100		40		50		20

a. select all this data -> press Ctrl+Alt+V (special paste) -> select Transpose option.
b. select 6 rows of 2 column -> go to address bar -> write formula =TRANSPOSE(C33:H34) (this also called array formula) and press Ctrl+Shift+Enter. 

5. Sort/Filter 
By UI

6. Tables
a. select data -> Insert tab -> select Table.
b. I have 3 column and want to sum then -> select all 3 column for 1 row and Alt+= and Enter
c. If I want total -> select one cell -> on design tab -> check Total Row.

8. How we can import data or bringing data into our excel from local machine.
   There are multiple ways to import data.

a. Go to Data tab -> Click on Existing Connections -> In show drop-down select -> this computer option -> Click on Browse for More... -> selct your csv file.

b. Go to your git -> select csv file -> click on Raw (so that you have the final location) -> https://github.com/ajaykuma/Datasets_For_Work/blob/main/AirPassengers.csv -> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajaykuma/Datasets_For_Work/main/AirPassengers.csv (after click on RAW) -> Now go to Data tab in Excel and select From Web and paste RAW url.
